# beatmap-lens

A pre-release TypeScript toolkit for 4K-10K `osu!mania` beatmaps.

The package is not published, and its API can still change.

```ts
import {
  createRenderDocument,
  createRenderScene,
  iterateOsz,
  parseBeatmap,
  parseOsz,
  parseOsu,
  renderSvg,
  renderSvgPages,
  serializeSvg,
  serializeSvgPages,
  toManiaChart,
} from "beatmap-lens";

const beatmap = parseBeatmap(osuSource);
const sceneOptions = {
  range: beatmap.chart.range,
};
const svg = renderSvg(beatmap.chart, sceneOptions);

// Advanced path: use each stage independently.
const parsedOsu = parseOsu(osuSource);
const chart = toManiaChart(parsedOsu);
const scene = createRenderScene(chart, { range: chart.range });
const sameSvg = serializeSvg(scene);

// Fixed-size static review pages.
const pages = renderSvgPages(beatmap.chart, {
  range: beatmap.chart.range,
});

// Advanced document path: inspect resolved layout before serialization.
const document = createRenderDocument(beatmap.chart, {
  range: beatmap.chart.range,
});
const samePages = serializeSvgPages(document);

const beatmapSet = await parseOsz(oszBytes);

for await (const loadedBeatmap of iterateOsz(oszBytes, { maxConcurrency: 1 })) {
  // Each beatmap is complete and already linked to its shared audio when present.
}
```

`parseBeatmap` is the ordinary entry point: retain its `Beatmap`, then pass `beatmap.chart` to
`renderSvg` for one scene or `renderSvgPages` for a fixed-size review document.
`parseOsu`/`toManiaChart`, `createRenderScene`/`serializeSvg`, and
`createRenderDocument`/`serializeSvgPages` remain the advanced, composable boundaries.

Every render describes one bounded, contiguous source-time interval. `range` is the only required
`RenderSceneOptions` field and uses half-open `[startMs, endMs)` membership. Use `chart.range` for
an intentional complete-chart render; there is no zero-option, implicitly unbounded render. Time
runs from bottom to top by default, placing `startMs` at the lower edge and later time progressively
higher. Set `timeDirection: "top-to-bottom"` for the opposite presentation.

`pixelsPerSecond`, `playfield`, `timeDirection`, and `theme` are optional. The linear scale defaults
to `240 px/s`, while the playfield defaults to the complete scene size `{ widthPx: 640 }`. A supplied
playfield must choose exactly one sizing mode:

```ts
const sceneOptions = {
  range: { startMs: 60_000, endMs: 75_000 },
  playfield: { laneWidthPx: 72 }, // Or: { widthPx: 640 }, never both.
  theme: {
    metrics: {
      paddingPx: { top: 32, bottom: 32 },
      laneGapPx: 6,
      noteHeightPx: 10,
    },
  },
};

const svg = renderSvg(beatmap.chart, sceneOptions, { title: "60s to 75s" });
```

`theme.metrics` is nested and partial: unspecified padding sides and metrics retain their defaults.
SVG-only metadata such as `title` is a separate serializer option, accepted by the third argument
of `renderSvg` or the second argument of `serializeSvg`.

### Render defaults

| Input | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `range` | Yes | None; use `chart.range` intentionally for the complete chart |
| `pixelsPerSecond` | No | `240` |
| `playfield` | No | `{ widthPx: 640 }` |
| `timeDirection` | No | `"bottom-to-top"` |
| `theme.metrics.paddingPx` | No | `{ top: 24, right: 16, bottom: 24, left: 16 }` |
| `theme.metrics.laneGapPx` | No | `4` |
| `theme.metrics.noteHeightPx` | No | `8` |
| `theme.metrics.noteInsetPx` | No | `5` |
| `theme.metrics.noteRadiusPx` | No | `2` |
| serializer `title` | No | Metadata artist/title/version plus the key-count label; the key-count label alone when metadata is absent |

### Fixed-size static review documents

`renderSvgPages` returns a deterministic array because document layout may need more than one
image. Every page uses the same exact size; panels run chronologically from left to right and then
continue on the next page. A panel remains an ordinary bounded `RenderScene` with half-open range
membership and its own narrow source-time axis.

```ts
const pages = renderSvgPages(beatmap.chart, {
  range: { startMs: 60_000, endMs: 70_000 },
  page: {
    size: { widthPx: 1600, heightPx: 900 },
    columns: "auto",
  },
  panel: {
    playfield: { laneWidthPx: 48 },
    maxNoteRows: 32,
    maxSourceDurationMs: 10_000,
  },
  scale: { type: "linear", pixelsPerSecond: 240 },
});
```

Page width controls how many panels fit, while `maxNoteRows` controls where one panel may break.
Simultaneous notes count as one row. The default document is `1600 x 900px`, uses `24px` page
padding, a `12px` panel gap, a `48px` lane width, up to 32 note rows and 10 seconds per panel,
bottom-to-top time, linear `240px/s`, auto columns, and an attached left-side `32px` axis. Import
`renderDefaults` to
inspect the exported baseline values; inspect `document.resolved` for the chart-specific runtime
result.

Three scale modes keep their intent explicit:

- `linear` uses one hard pixels-per-second value and adds panels or pages when needed;
- `fit` remains true linear time and chooses one global value between its preferred and minimum
  scales to attain the minimum reachable page count;
- `row-aware` uses a piecewise-linear projection, expands dense distinct rows, and compresses only
  empty time that contains no active long note.

```ts
const compactPages = renderSvgPages(beatmap.chart, {
  range: { startMs: 60_000, endMs: 70_000 },
  scale: {
    type: "row-aware",
    basePixelsPerSecond: 240,
    minRowGapPx: 12,
    maxEmptyGapPx: 72,
  },
});
```

Row-aware axis labels still show true source time, but visual distance is intentionally non-linear.
Its SVG panels carry `data-time-scale="row-aware"`, and enabled axes mark compressed ranges.
`RenderTimeProjection` is a discriminated union; narrow on `projection.type` before reading the
linear-only `pixelsPerSecond` field.

### osu!lazer mania visual speed

Use `osuLazerManiaPixelsPerSecond` to match lazer's baseline note spacing for its standard desktop
landscape playfield:

```ts
const pixelsPerSecond = osuLazerManiaPixelsPerSecond({
  scrollSpeed: 22,
  gameplayViewport: { widthPx: 1710, heightPx: 1112 },
}); // ≈ 1783.944 px/s
```

Pass the final landscape gameplay rectangle. Its dimensions and the returned speed use the same
pixel coordinate space; physical DPI/PPI is not an input.

The adapter result can also be passed as a hard document scale:

```ts
const pages = renderSvgPages(beatmap.chart, {
  range: { startMs: 60_000, endMs: 70_000 },
  scale: { type: "linear", pixelsPerSecond },
});
```

Here the simulated gameplay viewport is not the export page size. Using the value as
`row-aware.basePixelsPerSecond` only makes it a local spacing reference; that non-linear output no
longer matches osu!lazer scroll distance.

Use the scene's canonical projection for every time/scene coordinate conversion:

```ts
import { projectTime, unprojectTime } from "beatmap-lens";

const yPx = projectTime(scene.projection, chart.range.startMs);
const sourceMs = unprojectTime(scene.projection, yPx);
```

`projectTime` and `unprojectTime` use scene-local Y coordinates. Their geometric domain is closed,
so both projection endpoints are valid even though note membership is half-open. Non-finite or
out-of-domain inputs throw `RangeError`. `RenderScene` retains resolved numeric precision; the SVG
serializer preserves finite JavaScript numeric values when encoding text.

The package is ESM-only, DOM-free, and performs no implicit file or network reads. It detects the
key count of valid `osu!mania` files from `[Difficulty] CircleSize` and supports 4K-10K normal
notes, long notes, bounded render scenes, SVG serialization, and in-memory `.osz` archives.

`Beatmap` composes `.osu` source, its parsed document, its normalized chart, and an optional pointer
to `BeatmapAudio`. `connectBeatmapAudio` creates that connection without copying audio bytes.
`parseOsz` asynchronously returns a `BeatmapSet` whose difficulties already point to shared
referenced audio objects. Missing audio is valid and leaves the pointer undefined. `iterateOsz`
yields the same complete beatmaps one at a time when a caller does not need to wait for the whole
set.

Archive loading inflates `.osu` entries and only audio referenced by supported beatmaps. It never
loads backgrounds, videos, hitsounds, or unrelated audio. Inflation is asynchronous and limited to
two concurrent entries by default. Set `maxConcurrency` from 1 through 8 to trade throughput for
transient memory use.

The cumulative uncompressed size selected from one archive is capped at 256 MiB by default. Set
`maxInflatedBytes` on `parseOsz` or `iterateOsz` to choose another finite non-negative budget. The
loader rejects before crossing the limit; `NaN`, infinity, and negative budgets are invalid.

Archive entry names currently use UTF-8 decoding; legacy Shift-JIS filename fallback is not yet
included.

Audio byte arrays are shared by reference and are never copied or mutated by Beatmap Lens after
connection. Callers remain responsible for the arrays and for any browser resources created from
them.

The package boundary is every integer key count from 4K through 10K. The normalized chart,
diagnostics, render scene, analysis, and serialization stages share one key-count-aware pipeline
rather than separate per-key-count APIs. The first-party Inspector prioritizes 4K-7K at the app
layer; that narrower delivery priority does not reduce the package range.

Semantic chart-quality findings and synchronized audio playback remain project direction, not
current package features. See the [repository](https://github.com/Pulsefield/beatmap-lens) for the
status and architecture.

One `RenderScene` intentionally covers one range and one playfield. Fixed-size solving, horizontal
layout, pagination, and readable spacing live in the separate `RenderDocument` layer. Beat-aligned
pagination, full timing/SV scroll-speed parity, and PNG/raster output remain deferred.
